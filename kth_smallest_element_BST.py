Leetcode: Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.


Time Complexity: O(H+k), where H is tree height and k is smallest element. (worse case H=N for unbalanced tree) 
Space Complexity: O(H+k), needed for stack.
