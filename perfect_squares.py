Leetcode: Perfect Squares

Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

Time Complexity: O(n^2), 
    The depth of the BFS is at most 4 by the four-square theorem (every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares)
    At every depth there will be at most sqrt(n) children, because there's at most sqrt(n) perfect squares that are smaller than n
    (sqrt(n))^4 = nÂ²
Space Complexity: O(n^2),
